# Homeownership and Wealth Accumulation Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of homeownership on wealth accumulation for low-income and minority households. Inspired by the article "Does Homeownership Reduce Wealth?" the Python scripts use regression analysis to explore wealth disparities and the factors influencing them.
## Project Structure
- **Homeownership&WealthAccumulation.py**: The main script that loads the dataset, calculates summary statistics, and performs regression analysis.
- **Table.py**: A script that focuses on the visualization of wealth accumulation differences between White and minority households.
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis.
